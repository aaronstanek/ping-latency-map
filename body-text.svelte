<p>
	<br />

	Ever wondered how long it takes for a digital message to zip around the globe? This map shows you
	exactly that!

	<br /><br />

	<a href="https://wondernetwork.com/pings">WonderNetwork</a> timed how long it takes for computers
	in different cities to send each other a quick hello (called a "ping" in computer circles). The
	blue dots on the map represent cities with the fastest replies to a sample ping, while the red
	dots show cities with slower replies.

	<br /><br />

	You can choose which cities to start from and set a time threshold using the controls below. If
	the ping time between any of your source cities and a particular city on the map is less than the
	time threshold, that city is marked with a blue dot. If the ping time is greater than the time
	threshold, that city is marked with a red dot.

	<br /><br />

	Let's see how far your digital hellos can travel!
